2601. Prime Subtraction Operation
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.
You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:
Pick an index i that you havenâ€™t picked before, and pick a prime p strictly less than nums[i], then subtract p from nums[i].
Return true if you can make nums a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise.
A strictly increasing array is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,9,6,10]
Output: true
Explanation: In the first operation: Pick i = 0 and p = 3, and then subtract 3 from nums[0], so that nums becomes [1,9,6,10].
In the second operation: i = 1, p = 7, subtract 7 from nums[1], so nums becomes equal to [1,2,6,10].
After the second operation, nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is true.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,8,11,12]
Output: true
Explanation: Initially nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so we don't need to make any operations.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,8,3]
Output: false
Explanation: It can be proven that there is no way to perform operations to make nums sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is false. 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
nums.length == n
